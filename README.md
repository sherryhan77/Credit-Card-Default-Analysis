This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables: 
X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.

X5: Age (year). 
X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.;-2 = Balance paid in full and no transactions this period (we may refer to this credit card account as having been 'inactive' this period);-1 = Balance paid in full, but account has a positive balance at end of period due to recent transactions for which payment has not yet come due;0 = Customer paid the minimum due amount, but not the entire balance. I.e., the customer paid enough for their account to remain in good standing, but did revolve a balance
